# Pathfinding Visualizer

Pathfinding visualizer project featuring both weighted and unweighted graphs. Currently, BFS and Dijkstra are the only algorithms that have been implemented. I built this project mainly as a way to learn more about JavaScipt and React and because I simply thought that pathfinding algorithms were cool.
